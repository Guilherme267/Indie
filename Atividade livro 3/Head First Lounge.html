        teas, and coffees, or, stay a bit longer and enjoy the multicultural culinary menu that combines a harmony of taste,

        Our guarantee: at the lounge, we're committed to providing you, our guest, with an exceptional experience every time you

        But that's not all; at night, join us in the backroom as our resident DJ spins a choice selection of trance and drum&bass
        beats across our spacious tiki-themed dance floor. Or just hang out in one of our comfy white vinyl booths at the dance
        bar. You can have your elixirs delivered from the main lounge right to the dance floor. If you've had enough of the beat,
        just head back to the lounge area to relax. And, no matter where you find yourself in the lounge, you'll always be
        connected with our wireless Internet access
